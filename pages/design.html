                        <h3>Redesigning Netflix: Problem Statement</h3>
                        <p>Despite its popularity, Netflix faces challenges with user engagement and satisfaction due to its complex user interface and navigation system. Users often struggle to discover content tailored to their preferences, leading to frustration and decreased retention rates. Additionally, the current design lacks cohesion across platforms, resulting in a disjointed experience for users transitioning between devices.
                            <br> The primary objective is to overhaul the Netflix user experience to improve usability, content discoverability, and overall customer satisfaction. This redesign aims to streamline navigation, personalize content recommendations, and create a seamless experience across all platforms (web, mobile, and TV). By enhancing user engagement and satisfaction, the redesigned Netflix interface seeks to increase user retention and drive continued growth in subscription numbers.
